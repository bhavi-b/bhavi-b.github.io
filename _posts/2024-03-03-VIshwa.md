I participated in VishwaCTF 2024 with <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/16691/">InfoSecIITR</a>. We finished **1st** out of all the teams that participated in the competition.

## Steganography

### We Are Valorant

*One day, while playing Valorant, I received a mail from Riot Games that read,

“In a world full of light, sometimes the shadows help you win.” “Your Signature move also helps you a lot ; develop one and ace it now.”

It also had an image and a video/gif attached to it. I am not able to understand what they want to say. Help me find what the message wants to express.*

In the challenge we are given `Astra.mp4` and `we_are_valorant.jpg`

Uploading the jpg on aperisolve, we get common passwords.

![aperi](/assets/images/valo.png)

Trying the first password with steghide gives us `not_a_secret.txt` which says

```
Hello!!
hope you are enjoying the CTF
here's your flag


VishwaCTF{you_are_invited_to_the_biggest_valorant_event}
```

### Secret Code

*Akshay has a letter for you and need your help*

In the challenge we are provided with `confidential.jpg` and `letter.txt`.
Running binwalk on confidential.jpg we get a zip file `5ecr3t_c0de.zip` and a helper.txt.
Helper.txt states that the password to the new zip file is a 6 digit number.
Thus we make a wordlist that satisfies the given criteria and run `John The Ripper`.

![jtr](/assets/images/jtr.png)

The passcode - **945621**

We get `5ecr3t_c0de.txt` which has the pixel coordinates. Coloring these pixels white makes the flag completely visible.

```py
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open("confidential.jpg")
data = im.load()
width,height = im.size
f = open("./5ecr3t_c0de.txt","r")
lines = f.readlines()
for l in lines:
    x,y = l.strip()[1:-1].split(", ")
    x = int(x)
    y = int(y)
    data[x,y] = (255,255,255)
im.show()
im.save(fp="final.jpg")
```

### Professor's Inheritance

*As we dive deeper into maths, it gets harder and harder. Mr. Rick a maths professor has also been facing such challenges. His mentor Mr. Newton left the key to his legacy encrypted in the following files but he has to prove that he is his student to get access to it. Help Mr.Rick solve the questions and decode the key.*

*Find the next number in the series. Series: 5, 12, 23, 50, 141, 488, 1859, 7326, ?*

Next number: `29177`

In the challenge we are given, `TunePocket-Rock-Guitar-Power-Intro-Preview.wav` and `encryptedcode.txt.nc` which is mcrypt encrypted file.

Using deepsound on the wav file we extract an image.

![prof_image](/assets/images/prof.png)

Running **stegosuite** on the image we find the following message

```
The letters of the word "VISHWA" are permuted in all possible ways and the words thus formed are arranged as in a dictionary. The rank of the word "VISHWA" is
Answer in the following format:
VISHWA-ANS
Example: Answer of above question is 127 then password for next file is:
VISHWA-127
```

Therefore,the password is `VISHWA-545`

Command: `mcrypt -d encryptedcode.txt.nc`

Using this password we get the `encryptedcode.txt` which has the following contents

```js
function _0x9b13(_0x2a7d1e, _0x2dc359) {
    const _0x59ade7 = _0x59ad();
    return _0x9b13 = function(_0x9b13d5, _0x72f1ea) {
        _0x9b13d5 = _0x9b13d5 - 0x1e3;
        let _0x37191c = _0x59ade7[_0x9b13d5];
        return _0x37191c;
    }, _0x9b13(_0x2a7d1e, _0x2dc359);
}
const _0x2eeaaf = _0x9b13;
(function(_0x3f030f, _0x4bf6b1) {
    const _0x490c84 = _0x9b13,
        _0x13dacc = _0x3f030f();
    while (!![]) {
        try {
            const _0x2ad922 = -parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1ec)) / 0x1 * (parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1ee)) / 0x2) + -parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1ed)) / 0x3 * (parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1ea)) / 0x4) + parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1e6)) / 0x5 + -parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1e8)) / 0x6 * (-parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1e4)) / 0x7) + parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1e9)) / 0x8 * (parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1e7)) / 0x9) + -parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1ef)) / 0xa + -parseInt(_0x490c84(0x1eb)) / 0xb;
            if (_0x2ad922 === _0x4bf6b1) break;
            else _0x13dacc['push'](_0x13dacc['shift']());
        } catch (_0x29f1d5) {
            _0x13dacc['push'](_0x13dacc['shift']());
        }
    }
}(_0x59ad, 0x2e67a));
let hexArray = ['56', '69', '73', '68', '77', '61', '43', '54', '46', '7b', '61', '34', '74', '68', '30', '72', '5f', '73', '61', '34', '79', '61', '7d'];

function _0x59ad() {
    const _0x174950 = ['1012WHsjvS', '651805BeNskl', '13031Kbcsug', '1845pCtCOx', '38eVCyrm', '1816090XhAWlX', 'length', 'fromCharCode', '643867uhhKfL', 'log', '1121035lmfkQH', '9iVMgaH', '18OJRFjA', '2671776GkWnpv'];
    _0x59ad = function() {
        return _0x174950;
    };
    return _0x59ad();
}

function hexToAscii(_0x5b4e2e) {
    const _0x13baed = _0x9b13;
    let _0x46040d = '';
    for (let _0x22baaa = 0x0; _0x22baaa < _0x5b4e2e[_0x13baed(0x1f0)]; _0x22baaa++) {
        _0x46040d += String[_0x13baed(0x1e3)](parseInt(_0x5b4e2e[_0x22baaa], 0x10));
    }
    return _0x46040d;
}
console[_0x2eeaaf(0x1e5)](hexToAscii(hexArray));
```

Observing carefully `hexArray` is the ascii values of the flag.

Flag: `VishwaCTF{a4th0r_sa4ya}` 

## Digital Forensics

### Wired Secrets

*You are an intern at the Cyber Security Department of India and you have been assigned your first case. The Department has finally caught a notorious Hacker who communicates online in a Secretive manner. It is suspected that this file might contain clues to unlock critical information. Your task is to analyse the file and decipher any hidden messages or patterns to progress further in the investigation,*

*PS: Zero is Hero, and dont forget to treat brackets neatly.*

*Note : Flag has upper case letter and numbers only*

Attachments: okay10.pcapng

In the challenge we are given `USB` packets which contain the data of a mouse.

On observing we find that the packets of length `31` have the data for the mouse, so we use the filter `frame.len == 31`

I found a great tool for plotting the data of the
[mouse](https://github.com/WangYihang/USB-Mouse-Pcap-Visualizer "mouse")

After exporting the filtered packets to a new pcap file

`poetry run python usb-mouse-pcap-visualizer.py -i ./<name>.pcap`

![blur](/assets/images/wired_blur.png)

There is some junk data, hence we filter the packets from number 11000 onwards but that is still not enough

![notsoblur](/assets/images/wired_notsoblur.png)

Now we just take the packets from 12000-14500 and from 14500 onwards the next time

![wiredclear](/assets/images/wired_clear.png)

Flag: `VishwaCTF{KUD0SD3T3CTIVE}`

### Router |Port|

*There's some unusual traffic on the daytime port, but it isn't related to date or time requests. Analyze the packet capture to retrieve the flag*

Attachments: Capture.pcapng

Opening the capture file in wireshark and analysing the protocol hierarchy we see that there is `daytime protocol`

![hierarchy](/assets/images/router_protocol.png)

Looking at the daytime packets we see that there are **ROT-13** string in the load

![daytime](/assets/images/router_daytime.png)

```py
from scapy.all import *

pkts = rdpcap("./Capture.pcapng")
x = b""
for i in range(len(pkts)):
    try:
        if pkts[i]['TCP'].sport == 13:
            x+=pkts[i].load
    except:
        pass

print(x.decode())
```

Using Python and Scapy to carve the relevant data and decoding the ROT cipher using Cyberchef we get:
```
Hey, mate!Yo, long time no see!You sure this mode of communication is still safe?Yeah, unless someone else is capturing network packets on the same network we're using. Anyhow, our text is encrypted, and it would be difficult to interpret.So let's hope no one else is capturing.What's so confidential that you're about to share?It's about cracking the password of a person with the username 'Anonymous.'Oh wait! Don't you know I'm not so good at password cracking?Yeah, I know, but it's not about cracking. It's about the analysis of packets. I've completed most of the job, even figured out a way to get the session key to decrypt and decompress the packets.Holy cow! How in the world did you manage to get this key from his device?Firstly, I hacked the router of our institute and closely monitored the traffic, waiting for 'Anonymous' to download some software that requires admin privilege to install. Once he started the download, I, with complete control of the router, replaced the incoming packets with the ones I created containing malicious scripts, and thus gained a backdoor access to his device. The further job was a piece of cake.Whoa! It's so surprising to see how much you know about networking or hacking, to be specific.Yeah, I did a lot of research on that. Now, should we focus on the purpose of this meet?Yes, of course. So, what should I do for you?Have you started the packet capture as I told you earlier?Yes, I did.Great! I will be sending his SSL key, so find the password of 'Anonymous.'Yes, I would, but I need some details like where to start.The only details I have are he uses the same password for every website, and he just went on to register for a CTF event.Okay, I will search for it.Wait a second, I won't be sending the SSL key on this Daytime Protocol port; we need to keep this untraceable.I will be sending it through FTP. Since the file is too large, I will be sending it in two parts. Please remember to merge them before using it. Additionally, some changes may be made to it during transfer due to the method I'm using. Ensure that you handle these issues.Okay! ...
```

The message points to `FTP-DATA`, which contained the SSL keys we had to use to decrypt the data, But the text of the file was encoded using another ROT Cipher.

Loading the keys into wireshark and applying the filter `http2` we get the required password(flag)
