I participated in Nullcon HackIM CTF 2023 with the team <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/16691/">InfoSecIITR</a>. We finished **4th** out of the **397** teams that participated in this competition.

# U Do Pee ?

In this challenge we were given a pcap file, the description indicates the usage of a tool called `udptunnel`.

On opening the pcap we find 16 `UDP` packets, after looking through the packets we see some `junk data at the start of every payload` which is possibly due to udptunnel being used.

![The packets sorted by time](/assets/images/udopee1.png "Packets in Wireshark")

Most of the packets have payload of length 54 bytes but three packets stand out.

`54` bytes is the length of the `junk` data.

On careful observation, we find the magic bytes `PK` in packets, which indicates the presence of a `zip` file.

![Packet 7](/assets/images/udopee2.png "flag.txt under PK magic bytes")

On extracting the payload from those packets by using `scapy` and dumping the bytes into a new binary we retrieve a `zip` file which is password protected.

```python
from scapy.all import *

ps = rdpcap("./udopee.pcap")

x = b""

for p in ps:
    if len(p.load)>100:
        x+=p.load[54:]

with open("file","wb") as file:
    file.write(x)
    file.close()
```

However, the first packet has the word password in it. Using `password` as password we get a `flag.txt` file which has a `base64` encoded string in it, decoding the string we get the flag.

**Flag: `ENO{AN0TH3R_TUNN3L_AN0THER_CHALL}`**
